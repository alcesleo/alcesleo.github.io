title: Vim folding for dummies
---

Vim has a really powerful mechanism for folding, it has lots of different commands and settings you can tweak to make it behave just the way you want it - but _sometimes you just want something out of your way._

* `zf` - folds the region selected by a motion or from visual mode (to fold a paragraph for example do `zfip` or `vipzf`)
* `zo` - opens the fold under the cursor
* `zR` - opens every fold
