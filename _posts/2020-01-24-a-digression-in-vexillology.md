title: A Digression in Vexillology
---

A while back, I spent an entire evening categorizing the world's flags into different categories in a spreadsheet - because I literally had nothing better to do. I saw a lot of similarities between flags, and though I'm sure there are interesting historical reasons, I was more interested in exploring the current state of flags in the world.

# The data

I decided to limit my dataset to the [193 UN member states][un_members], because defining what a country is [is not as easy as it sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AivEQmfPpk), and this makes for a reasonably complete list. It covers the area marked in green:

![UN Area][un_coverage]

It does have some notable exceptions:

- England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland which are only members as part of the UK
- Western Sahara, which is a disputed territory
- Palestine, which has a [decent flag][palestine]
- The Vatican, [which doesn't][vatican]

# Stripes

**128 (66%)** of all flags in the world have _stripes_. Exactly **100 (52%)** of the flags have _horizontal stripes_, **35 (18%)** have _vertical stripes_.[^not_crosses]

[^not_crosses]: Not counting crosses as stripes in either direction.

Only **7 (4%)** countries have _both vertical and horizontal stripes_:

- Belarus
- Benin
- Central African Republic
- Guinea-Bissau
- Madagascar
- Oman
- United Arab Emirates

**57 (30%)** countries have exactly _3 horizontal stripes_, and **23 (12%)** have exactly _3 vertical stripes_.

## Most stripey

Whereas no country has more than 3 vertical stripes (that would be insane), _Malaysia_ and the _US_ are tied for first place in the horizontal stripe race:

| Country  | Horizontal Stripes |
| :------- | :----------------- |
| Malaysia | 13                 |
| USA      | 13                 |
| Liberia  | 11                 |
| Greece   | 9                  |
| Uruguay  | 9                  |
| Zimbabwe | 7                  |
| Uganda   | 6                  |

15 countries _technically_ have 5 stripes, although only Costa Rica, Cuba, Thailand and Togo _properly_ have 5 stripes.

- Botswana
- Eswatini
- Cape Verde
- Israel
- Kenya
- **Costa Rica**
- **Cuba**
- Mozambique
- North Korea
- **Thailand**
- Republic of The Gambia
- South Sudan
- Suriname
- **Togo**
- Uzbekistan

The others are basically wannabe 3-stripers but with little gaps between the main stripes. Israel is the most subtle which really does look like 3 stripes, but actually has white stripes at the top and bottom:

![Flag of Israel][israel]

Only the Central African Republic, Comoros and Mauritius have _4 stripes_, **Mauritius** being the only plain 4-striped flag in the world.

![Flag of Mauritius][mauritius]

# Stars

There are a total number of **273** stars on all of the country flags, spread out among **72 (37%)** of the countries.

Unlike in the stripes department where the US had to settle for a tie, when it comes to stars the US with its **50** stars absolutely destroys its competition with just under twice as many stars as the runner up, Brazil which has **27**. Brazil in turn has more than twice as many stars as Uzbekistan which scanters into third with a measly **12** stars.

| Country                          | Stars |
| :------------------------------- | :---- |
| USA                              | 50    |
| Brazil                           | 27    |
| Uzbekistan                       | 12    |
| Cape Verde                       | 10    |
| Dominica                         | 10    |
| Tuvalu                           | 9     |
| Bosnia and Herzegovina           | 9\*   |
| Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela | 8     |

**42 (22%)** of the flags have but a single star.

## Seeing stars

I thought counting stars would be at worst boring, provided more flags looked similar to the US flag. Boy was I wrong, what counts as a star?

- [Argentina][argentina] and [Uruguay][uruguay] have suns on them, they count as stars right?
- [Antigua and Barbuda][antigua_barbuda] and [Bosnia Herzegovina][bosnia_herzegovina]\* feature _half stars_ - I decided to count them as full stars and not use any decimal points.
- [Costa Rica][costa_rica] among others feature small stars inside the emblems of their flags, I counted them like any other.
- [India][india] looks like it might have a star, but [it's actually a wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_India)

Look at the [dataset][dataset] to see how I got the final tally.

# Crosses

**13 (7%)** countries have a cross on their flag.

The following have the Scandinavian off-center cross:

- Denmark
- Finland
- Iceland
- Norway
- Sweden

And the rest have a symmetrical cross:

- Dominica
- Dominican Republic
- Greece
- Malta
- Switzerland
- Tonga
- UK

Georgia really likes crosses and has 5:

# Cantons

**13 (7%)** _other_ countries have a canton on their flag:

- Australia
- Chile
- Fiji
- Greece
- Liberia
- Malaysia
- New Zealand
- Samoa
- Togo
- Tonga
- Tuvalu
- Uruguay
- USA

I personally don't think that any of these are particularly good, except for **Liberia** which is a nicer and cleaner version of the US flag. Slim down the number of stripes, replace the star extravaganza with a single classy star, and make the square actually square and a more tasteful size, much better:

![Flag of Liberia][liberia]

# Maps

Only one of the UN Member States has a map of their own country on their flag, Cyprus:

![Flag of Cyprus][cyprus]

I think it's brilliant.[^map_as_flag]

[^map_as_flag]: Though I like them - maps are not [very good flag design.][roman_mars]

Though they are not members of the UN, I still want to mention the flag of Kosovo, and Graham Bartram design of the flag of Antarctica, which I also really like:

![Flag of Kosovo][kosovo]

![Flag of Antarctica][antarctica]

# Toplist

These all make my list for basically the same reason: I think that they are all the best examples of very popular and traditional flag designs, while at the same time being unique and having their own twist to them, making them both instantly recognizable, familiar, but also memorable and clearly distinct from the many other similar flags out there. World class.

They are of course my personal opinion and nothing else.

Honorable mentions: Great Britain, South Korea, Japan

## 1. South Africa

By far my favourite, excellent colours and shapes.

![Flag of South Africa][south_africa]

## 2. Norway

The best of the Scandinavian crosses, followed by [Iceland][iceland] which is inverted, the other ones have pretty poor color choices in my opinion.

![Flag of Norway][norway]

## 3. Congo

Simple 3 stripes African colors, but diagonally - beautiful.

![Flag of Congo][congo]

# Bottomlist

I don't know if I even have to put a disclaimer here saying that this is only my personal opinion, because these are truly terrible flags.

Dishonorable mentions: [Nepal][nepal], [Sri Lanka][sri_lanka]

## 1. Haiti

When you use MS Paint to put a picture with a white background in the middle of your flag, should you really have one?

![Flag of Haiti][haiti]

## 2. Lebanon

It'd be difficult to let this one stay up on the fridge for long even if drawn by your own child.

![Flag of Lebanon][lebanon]

## 3. Maldives

This one is just dreary - the border is too wide, the moon is too narrow and the colors are depressing.
